-> agent
-> control system

control system can be serial

each control system may have its specific ui

gui for player

gui for god

todo: customize layout

----

press :
float text to input, in game window 
text printed to console 


todo:
reconstruct, make new demos
with new interface and consoles
reconstruct console superclass

each control group / player:
a set of windows : game window/ console window 
interface can switch between windows(if gui)
regardless whether same player


console(game.controlgroup) when init

todo:
a plot visualization buffer in qt



----

a spy game:
chatgroup spy game:
there are different chatgroups
each person has their own gifts and interest
 - interest
 - interest unfound 

use embedding vectors to assign these gifts
learn from realworld data

people tend to discuss topic of their interest

secret topics
some people are hostile 
so do not talk things with potentially hostile people

inactive groups can be dimissed

each group has a holder

create group-assign a holder

make union on ship console and room console

how to integrate namespace and user group

exec python in command


shader
texture setting and shader setting interface for each object

make a tool for creating camouflage
func: get avg normal vector for a curve surface
func: project a pattern to curve uv

animation
animation for thruster, including chemiccal and ion

a showbase for previewing texture and shading


implement robotarm

set a camera manager 
that dynamically manage different cameras
and their masks
-> use garbage collection
it also manages texture
or, it cooperates with texture manager

for each variable camera 
it alters corresponding texture

raw spectra texture: 
{T = [n_pixels, N_materials]
M = [N_materials, D_spectra]} stored for each texture
L = [c_channels, D_spectra] # or [batch, c, D]

# c << N << (n,D)
ML -> [N,c]
T(ML) -> [n,c]
light:
[D_spectra] # each light, may be sparse for single colour light
```
class Channel:
   cmf: ...

class Lens:
   Channels: [...]
# observed by texture


class ManagedTexture(Texture):
   spectra: ...
   lens: ... # channels 
   transform: ...
   pass
```
